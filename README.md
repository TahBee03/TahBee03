## Description
Hello! My name is Talike (pronounced tah-leek), and I am working towards being a full-stack software engineer. I have dreamed of being a video game developer for years now, but I have decided to work more towards how to create software for both mobile devices and computers. I have experience with a handful of programming languages, including C++ and Python. I hope to use these languages (as well as the ones I will learn in the future) and my problem-solving skills to create and/or improve software that users will find efficient, visually appealing, and -- if applicable -- entertaining to engage with.

## Languages
- C++
- Python
- Java
